# Keyboard Shortcuts

The theme ships interactive helpers to keep navigation fast. All shortcuts work on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

| Shortcut             | Action                            |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `âŒ˜ K` / `Ctrl K`     | Open the command palette          |
| `/`                  | Focus the search field            |
| `t`                  | Toggle between light and dark UI  |
| `?`                  | Show the keyboard shortcut dialog |
| `Esc`                | Close sidebar, palette, or dialog |

These handlers live in `mkdocs_shadcn_theme/templates/assets/js/theme.js`. If you override the script, keep the bindings unless you have a specific alternative in mind.

!!! tip
    Mention shortcuts in your docs when launching interactive features. User education drives adoption, especially for power users.
